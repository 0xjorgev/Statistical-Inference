Based on the CLT the mean of those 1000 simulations would be close to  $\\frac{1}{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{0.2} = 5$ according to the Normal distribution  \n\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nset.seed(1234)\n\nlambda <- 0.2\nn <- 40\nsim <- 1000\nexpSampleMeans <- NULL\n\nfor (i in 1:sim){\n  expSampleMeans <- c(expSampleMeans, mean(rexp(n, lambda)))\n}\n\nsampleMean <- mean(expSampleMeans)\nsampleStandar_deviation <- sd(expSampleMeans)\nsampleVariance <- var(expSampleMeans)\n\nhist(expSampleMeans, col = \"blue\")\n\nround(mean(expSampleMeans), 2)\n\nvar <- (1 / lambda)^2 / (n) \nmu <- 1/lambda\n\nmu\n\n\nvar\nround(mean(sampleVariance), 2)\n```\n\n## Sample Distribution and Normal Distribution\n\nBoth the mean of the sample and its variance are close to the theorical values (mean and variance) of the normal distribution. \n\nIn order to take a closer look at this values, lets now create a plot that contains both the sample means with a vertical line on its mean and lets overlap the normal distribution curve over those same values and another vertical line that shows the normal distribution mean (in red)\n\n```{r}\n\ndata <- as.data.frame(expSampleMeans)\nplot <- ggplot(data, aes(x = expSampleMeans));\nplot <- plot + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.4, color = 'blue', fill = 'white', aes(y = ..density..)) \nplot <- plot + stat_function(fun = dnorm, color = 'red', args = list(mean = 5, sd = sqrt(0.625))) \nplot <- plot + geom_vline(xintercept = mean(expSampleMeans), color=\"blue\");\nplot <- plot + geom_vline(xintercept = mu, color=\"red\");\nplot <- plot + labs(colour = \"Blue\")\nplot <- plot + labs(x = \"Sample Means\")\nplot <- plot + labs(title = \"Theorical Distribution Vs. Sample Distribution\")\n\nplot\n```\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe data fits in the normal distribution curve, as it migth be appreciated in the previous graph. To be more specific we migth stand that with the given conditions Exponential distribution, $n = 40$ and $\\lambda = 0.2$ \n\nThe distribution is approximately to $N(\\frac{1}{0.2}, \\frac{\\frac{1}{0.2}}{\\sqrt{40}})$ ",
